3.	Token Type: ERC-20 (Ethereum-based) for initial distribution, with plans for future migration to a native blockchain.
4.	Utility: QTC will serve as the primary medium of exchange within the QuantumCoin ecosystem, facilitating transactions, incentivizing network participants, and enabling governance functions.
5.	Decimals: 18
Distribution Model:
1.	Private Sale (20%): Reserved for strategic investors, early backers, and institutional partners who contribute capital during the private sale phase.
2.	Public Sale (25%): Open to the general public, with a capped allocation per participant to ensure fair distribution and prevent concentration of tokens in the hands of a few.
3.	Team and Advisors (15%): Allocated to incentivize the core development team, advisors, and partners vested over a predetermined period, ensuring alignment of interests with the long-term success of the project.
4.	Ecosystem Development (20%): Reserved for ecosystem growth, including liquidity provision, partnerships, marketing initiatives, community incentives, and developer grants to foster innovation and adoption.
5.	Reserve Fund (10%): Held in reserve to support future development, market stabilization, and unforeseen circumstances, with transparent governance mechanisms in place for fund allocation.
6.	Staking Rewards (5%): Reserved for participants who actively contribute to the network through staking QTC tokens, securing the network, and validating transactions.
7.	Community Airdrops and Rewards (5%): Distributed to early adopters, active community members, and contributors through various engagement programs, campaigns, and incentives.
Fundraising Goals:
1.	Private Sale Target: $5,000,000 - $10,000,000 USD
•	Secure commitments from strategic investors, venture capital firms, and institutional backers who believe in the project's vision and long-term potential.
2.	Public Sale Target: $10,000,000 - $20,000,000 USD
•	Engage with a wide range of retail investors and supporters through a transparent and accessible public sale process, leveraging both community-driven marketing efforts and strategic partnerships to reach the target.
3.	Total Fundraising Target: $15,000,000 - $30,000,000 USD
•	Combined proceeds from private and public sales will be allocated towards core development, ecosystem growth, marketing and outreach, legal and compliance expenses, as well as operational costs to ensure the successful launch and sustainable growth of the QuantumCoin project.
By adhering to a well-defined tokenomics model, transparent distribution plan, and achievable fundraising goals, QuantumCoin aims to instill confidence and trust among participants, laying a solid foundation for its success in the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape.
